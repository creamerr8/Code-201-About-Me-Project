    <h1>About Me</h1> 
    <p>Hi! My name is Ryan Creamer, I'm 20 years old and am from Puyallup, Washington. My work history is a bit all over the place. I have workes in a few differnt types of worl enviornments, but the majority have been customerservice based. My first job was a cashier job at Sears, then i left to work at a skating rink for the next two years. After i graduated high school i wanted to move on to a full time job so i left the skating rink and started working for an electrical company, i had another few jobs i was only at for short periods of time until i got hired at my most recent job making deliveries for Peloton. My education history is short and sweet i graduated everthing up to high school then i took a break and now i have landed at code fellows hoping to start again here. I chose this school because i love the idea of creating and building and i have always been interested in the tech world so i thought it was a perfect fit. I want to hopefully graduate from code fellows ready to move right into the job world and add to my knowladge and experiance and grow as a developer.  </p>
